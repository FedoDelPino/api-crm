# Customer Relationship Management - (Reactjs-App) :pushpin:
Hi, this is an app for "Customer Relationship Management" based on JSON-Server API implementation. This app is development by [ReactJS](https://es.reactjs.org) library and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) a CSS framework, also, it's created based on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).
The deployment is up through [Netlify](https://tiny-swan-a1b9ec.netlify.app/)

If you want to run this project, it's important to say, that you need to run a json-server based on the "db.json" file inside this repository. Also it's important to define the enviroment variables based on Vite.

Have Fun! :monkey_face:
